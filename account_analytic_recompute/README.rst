This module allows you to change the analytical account when the invoice is published.


Configuration
=============

Example:

If the invoice has already been approved and sent
as an electronic document, Odoo natively does not allow to
change the analytical account, with this module
you can modify the analytical accounts and
continue filling the table of analytical account lines.
