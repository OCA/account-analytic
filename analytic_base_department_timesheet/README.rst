Technical module to add account department to timesheet analysis report.
This module is also needed to avoid having an issue related to
``account_department_id``. When the module hr_timesheet is also
installed, the issue is raised of non-existing field
``account_department_id`` on model ``timesheets.analysis.report``. This
happens, because ``hr_timesheet.hr_timesheet_report_search`` view
defined for model ``timesheets.analysis.report`` is inherited from
``hr_timesheet.hr_timesheet_line_search`` view defined for model
``account.analytic.line``.
