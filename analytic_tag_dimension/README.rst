This module allows to group Analytic Tags on Dimensions.

Dimensions are created as custom field, then you can group by Dimensions on:

* Account/Adviser/Journal Items
* Account/Reports/Business Intelligence/Analytic Entries

When you set Tags on Analytic Entries, each custom field for dimensions is updated with its Tag.

One Tag is only allowed on one Dimension, and you can not set more than one Tag from same Dimensions on Analytic Entry.
