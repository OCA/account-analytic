To configure this module, you need to:

* go to /Invoicing/Configuration/Analytic Accounting/Analytic Accounts Dimensions to create new Analytic Dimensions.
* You can create new Analytic Tags on this form, or go to /Invoicing/Configuration/Analytic Accounting/Analytic Tags and set Dimension for each Tag.
* If you want to automatically add the fields generated on the basis of dimansions to the views, you must inherit the desired model to add _add_dynamic_fields_in_views = True
