This module allows to generate analytic distributions from the PoS
orders.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure the analytic distributions by store:

1. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Analytic Distribution Models*
2. We'll create one for every pos config.
3. Select an account prefix (Normally your incoming account prefix)
4. Select a PoS config (unhide it from the optionl fields).
5. Choose your desired distribution for that store.

Usage
=====

When you reconcile your sessions, the analytic distribution should go as
expected for your point of sale.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Add ``account_analytic_id`` in ``pos.order`` so we can use it in
   reports.
-  In ``13.0`` the session reconciliation has been refactored and thus
   the journal items are now very simplified. There's no product detail
   now, so we won't be able to analyze that level of detail anymore. For
   invoices it remains as it was.
