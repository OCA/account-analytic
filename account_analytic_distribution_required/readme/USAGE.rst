To use this module, you need to:

#. Create an invoice and add a line with an account of the same type you
   are configured above.
#. Add a tag that has an analytical distribution
   ('Analytic Distribution' field set to true) or an analytic account to that
   line.
#. When you validate the invoice you get a message if analytic account or
   distribution are incorrect.
