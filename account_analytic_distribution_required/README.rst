This module extends account_analytic_required and adds 2 policies to
control the use of analytic distributions. The policies behave as follow

* never: no analytic account nor analytic distribution allowed
* always: analytic account required
* always_plan: analytic_distribution required
* always_plan_or_account: analytic distribution or analytic account required
* optional: do what you like,

In any case analytic account and analytic distribution are mutually exclusive.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Account
   Types* and select the correct **Policy for analytic account** for every
   account type you want.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Create an invoice and add a line with an account of the same type you
   are configured above.
#. Add a tag that has an analytical distribution
   ('Analytic Distribution' field set to true) or an analytic account to that
   line.
#. When you validate the invoice you get a message if analytic account or
   distribution are incorrect.
