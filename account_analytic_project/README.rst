========================================
Project and analytic account integration
========================================

This module adds the inverse relation from analytic accounts to projects
(field project_ids).

The module also makes it more convenient to create a project for an analytic
account, providing a method for this. Withouth this module you would need to
specify that you would want to work with tasks, to indirectly create a project
for the analytic account.
