========================================
Project and analytic account integration
========================================

This module provides a usability improvement to create projects from analytic accounts,
as well as providing the inverse relationship project_ids field on analytic accounts.

Gives the option to create projects directly from the analytic accounts they
should be linked to.

Without this module, if you first create an analytic account and later on you
decide to have a project as well for this account, the situation is very
difficult to rectify.
