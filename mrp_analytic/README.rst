Analytic for manufacturing
==========================

This module links the manufacturing area with analytic management.

For now, it adds analytic account configuration for manufacturing orders,
and their corresponding shortcuts. Other modules can take advantage of
this link for other usages.

Usage
=====

There is a new field named "Analytic Account" in the Manufacturing Order.

You can also navigate from the Analytic Account to the related Manufacturing
Orders.
