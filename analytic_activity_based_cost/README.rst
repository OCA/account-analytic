With Activity Based Costing (ABC), costs are generated by activities.

Activities generating costs are represented as Analytic Items.
For example, a timesheet entry could be an activity.
Other activities could be captured to be stored in Odoo as Analytic Items.

These activity Analytic Items will automatically generate additional Analytic Items
for the costs driven this activity.
For example, a machine operating time could drive consumptions of Labor and Overhead.

The cost drivers are regular non-storable Products, with an additional definition
of the costs they drive.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

When creating Analytic Items for a cost driver Product,
the corresponding Analytic Items for driven cost are generated.

* When an Analytic Item is created, an automatic process
  checks the Activity Based Cost Rules to identify the ones that apply.
* Each rule creates a new Analytic Item for the driven costs,
  as a copy of the original one, with:

    * Product: set to rule's Cost Type Product.
      A validation error prevents this from being
      the same as the source Analytic Item Product, to avoid infinite loops.
    * Cost Quantity: is the original quantity multiplied by the rule's Factor
    * Cost Amount: is -1 * Quantity * Product Unit  Cost
    * Parent Analytic Item (new field): set with a link to the original Analytic Item
    * Quantity: zero, to avoid duplication
    * Amount: zero, to avoid duplication
    * Project and Task: if present, are reset, to avoid representing the driven costs
      as timesheet lines.

An update on the original Quantity triggers a recalculation of the quantity and amount of the child Analytic Items.

A delete cascades to the child Analytic Items, causing them to also be deleted.
