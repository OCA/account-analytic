Generate Activity Based Costs (ABC), using Analytic Items.

Activity Based Costing is a well documented technique to assign indirect costs to the the activities identified as cost drivers.
This feature models cost driver usage as Analytic Items.
When an Analytic Item is created, it may then generate additional Analytic Items for the corresponding indirect costs.
For example, each timesheet hour logged could generate a quantity and amount of overhead assigned to that activity.

This feature does not generate Account Moves.
That should be implemented by a separate feature.
