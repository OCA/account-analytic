With Activity Based Costing (ABC), costs are generated by activities.

Activities generating costs are represented as Analytic Items.
For example, a timesheet entry could be an activity.
Other activities could be captured to be stored in Odoo as Analytic Items.

These activity Analytic Items will automatically generate additional Analytic Items
for the costs driven this activity.
For example, a machine operating time could drive consumptions of Labor and Overhead.

The cost drivers are regular non-storable Products, with an additional definition
of the costs they drive.
