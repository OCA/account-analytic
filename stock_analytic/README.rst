**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

As necessary, go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Analytic Plans*, open the relevant
record and update the applicability for 'Stock Move'.

Usage
=====

To Assign an Analytic Account to a Stock Move
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need to:

#. Create manually or open draft picking
#. Add move lines and assign an **analytic account** in Analytic Distribution field

Assigned Journal Items created from Stock Move with Analytic Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If stock move automatically create journal entry, the journal entry will
contain journal items with following rule:

#. Journal item with account equal to product's valuation account will not be
   assigned to any analytic account.
#. Journal item with account different to product's valuation account will be
   assigned to an analytic account according to the stock move's analytic
   account.

Analytic applicability judgment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applicability of the analytic distribution is judged based on the applicability
settings of the analytic plan.

Note that this module adds the 'Stock Move' option to the business domain, and
'Operation Type' field.

Return moves are currently outside the scope of the validation / applicability judgment
(i.e. treated the same as optional) to allow some flexibility in the operation since
multiple factors (e.g. applicability of the original move) may need to be considered
to correctly judge the applicability.
