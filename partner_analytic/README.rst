This module allows to define two types of analytic account for each contact.

* The Income Analytic Account: The default analytic account used in Invoices / Credit Notes, when the product does not have a value. The value on the partner will act as a fallback for those lines having no value yet assigned.

* The Expense Analytic Account: Same as the Income Analytic Account, but it applies for Vendor Bills / Vendor Refunds.
