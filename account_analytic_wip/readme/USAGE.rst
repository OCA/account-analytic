The "Analytic Tracking Items" holds planned amounts, and track their WIP and variances.
These must be automatically created by specific logic in the Apps supporting them.

With this module alone the Tracking Item creation can be done manually:

* Navigate to ''Invoicing/Accounting > Reporting > Management > Analytic Tracking''

* Create an Analytic Tracking Item:

  * Set the Analytic Account.

  * Set the Product, use one that has a non-zero cost
    and belongs to a category with the "Costing" section configured.

  * Set the Planned Amount.


Analytic Items are used to record the actual costs:

* Navigate to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration
  > Analytic Accounting > Analytic Items*.

* Create an Analytic Item:

  * Set the Analytic Account, Description and Date.

  * Set the Product, use one that has a non-zero cost
    and belongs to a category with the "Costing" section configured.

  * Set the quantity consumed.

  * The Amount field should be automatically computed, with a negative amount.


Analytic Tracking Items are used to follow the costs incurred
and the comparison with the planned amounts. This can be used for analysis:

* Navigate to ''Invoicing/Accounting > Reporting > Management > Analytic Tracking''

* The list presents lines being tracked, and displays columns with Actual Amount,
  Expected Amount, WIP Amount, Variance Amount, etc.


WIP and variances journal entries are generated by a scheduled job:

* Navigate to *Setting > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions*.

* Locate and open the *Account: Process WIP and Variances* record, and click on the RUN MANUALLY button.

* Check the generated journal entries, at *Accounting > Miscellaneous > Journal Entries*.


When creating Analytic Items, if a configuration is in place, the corresponding Analytic Items for indirect cost are generated.

* When an Analytic Item is created, an automatic process checks the Activity Based Cost Rules to identify the ones that apply.
* Each triggered rule created a new Analytic Item, with a copy of the original one, and:
    * Product: is the rule Cost Type Product. A validation error prevents this from being the same as the source Analytic Item Product, to avoid infinite loops.
    * Quantity: is the original quantity multiplied by the rule's Factor
    * Amount: is -1 * Quantity * Product Standard Price
    * Parent Analytic Item (new field): set with the original Analytic Item
* An update on the Quantity triggers a recalculation of the quantity and amount of the child Analytic Items.
* A delete cascades to the child Analytic Items, causing them to also be deleted.
