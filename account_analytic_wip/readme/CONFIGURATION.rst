On the Product Category, "Costing" section, configure the accounts to use:

* **Consumption Account**: the account to credit.

* **Work in Progress Account**: the account to debit the work in progress amounts.

* **Variance Account**: the account to debit the variance versus the expected.

Enable the Analytic Accounting setting.

Create the Products representing the Cost Drivers to use:

* Navigate to *Invoicing/Accounting > Configuration > Analytic Accounting > Cost Drivers*,
  and create Products representing the Cost Types to use. Set:

  * *Is Cost Type* flag: checked. This will make the "Activity Costs" tab visible
  * *Activity Driven Costs* tab, add a line for each cost line to generate, such as overhead, etc.
    Set the standard cost to use for each unit used. This will roll up to the parent standard cost.
