On the Product Category, "Costing" section, configure the accounts to use:

* **Consumption Account**: the account to credit.

* **Work in Progress Account**: the account to debit the work in progress amounts.

* **Variance Account**: the account to debit the variance versus the expected.

Enable the Analytic Accounting setting.

Create the Products representing the Cost Types to use:

* Go to Invoicing/Accounting > ... > Products, and create Products representing the Cost Types to use.
  On a Cost Type product, set:

  * "Is Cost Type" flag: checked. This will make the "Activity Costs" tab visible
  * In the "Activity Costs" tab, add a line for each cost line to generate, such as overhead, etc.
    Set the standard cost to use for each unit used. Thesw will roll up to the parent cost type standard cost.
