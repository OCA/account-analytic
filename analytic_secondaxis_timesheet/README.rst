Timesheet Analytic Second Axis
==============================

Add a second analytical axis on analytic lines allowing you to make
reporting on.

Unless the account_analytic_plans from Odoo SA, this module allow
you to make cross-reporting between those two axes, like all analytic
lines that concern for example : The activity "Communication" and the
project "Product 1 Integration".

This second axis is called "activities" and you will be able to define
for each analytical account, what are the allowed activities for it.

This module enables the second axis on timesheet.
