This module allows to define an analytic account at product or category level
for using it when creating invoices.

This module is an alternative to the official module
*account_analytic_default*. The advantages of this module are:

* it only depends on the *account* module, whereas the
  *account_analytic_default* module depends on *sale_stock* ;

* the analytic account is configured on the product form or the product
  category form, and not on a separate object.
