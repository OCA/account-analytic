This module allows you to configure an **income analytic account** and an
**expense analytic account** on products and on product categories. When you
select the product in an invoice line, it will check if this product has an
income analytic account (for customer invoice/refunds) or an expense analytic
account (for supplier invoice/refunds) ; if it doesn't find any, it checks if
the category of the product has an income or expense analytic account ; if an
analytic account is found, it will be set by default on the invoice line.
