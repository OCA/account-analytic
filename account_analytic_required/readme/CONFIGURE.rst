Example:

If you want to have an analytic account on all your *expenses*,
set the policy to *always* for the account type *expense*.
If you try to save a journal items with an account of type *expense*
without analytic account, you will get an error message.

The analytic policy is company dependent. If you have a multi-company
environment, you should set its value for each company.
