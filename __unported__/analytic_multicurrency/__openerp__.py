Multi-Currency in Analytic Accounting
=====================================

This module improves OpenERP multi-currency handling in analytic
accounting, overall for multi-company.

This module is based on the work made in all c2c_multicost* available on
the v5.0 stable version and allows you to share analytic account between
company (even if currency differs in each one).

Features:

* Adapt the owner of analytic line (= to company that own the general
  account associated with an analytic line)

* Add multi-currency on analytic lines (similar to financial accounting)

* Correct all "costs" indicators into analytic account to base them on
  the right currency (owner's company)

* By default, nothing changes for single company implementation.

As a result, we can now really share the same analytic account between
companies that do not have the same currency. This setup becomes True,
Enjoy !

* Company A: EUR - Company B: CHF

* Analytic Account A: USD, owned by Company A

  - Analytic Account B: CHF, owned by Company A

  - Analytic Account C: EUR, owned by Company B


The difference with the regular 'Amount Currency':

* Regular 'Amount Currency' displays the amount currency of the related
  move line (only when linked with a move line, of course)
* Analytic Amount Currency displays the amount of the analytic move line
  converted to the right currency
