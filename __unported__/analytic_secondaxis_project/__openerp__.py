    """
    Add a second analytical axis on analytic lines allowing you to make
    reporting on.

    Unless the account_analytic_plans from OpenERP SA, this module allow you to
    make cross-reporting between those two axes, like all analytic lines that
    concern for example : The activity "Communication" and the project "Product
    1 Integration".

    This second axis is called "activities" and you will be able to define for
    each analytical account, what are the allowed activities for it.

    This module enables the second axis on projet.
